                <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                <p>
                    The average smartphone in the U.S has 2000+ photos. 
                    Ever spent 5 minutes scrolling to find a photo on your phone?  Is your Camera Roll filled with screenshots or 20 pictures of of tyring to capture that perfect jumping group photo? </p>

            <h2>Understand</h2>
            <p>I needed to learn more about how people currently maintained photos and what frustrations they felt.  I interviewed 6 people and analyzed the results, using an affinity map to find patterns in the data. 
            </p>
            <h3>Findings</h3>
            <p>Here are some of the highlights from what I learned in the interviews.</p>
            <h4>Multi-Shot</h4>
            <p>People often take 3-10 photos of a subject to get the best shot, but then neglect to delete the extras later. 
            </p>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="six columns">

            <p>Sharing affects how people remember and feel about photos.</p>
            <blockquote>Honestly, anything that I thought twice about, like, this was cool, I'm going to send this to someone else. And I'm sure those are the ones that I'm actually going to remember. – Joe
            </blockquote>
            <p>People used to delete photos when they backed up to a computer, but cloud storage means they have no reason to de-clutter anymore. </p>
            <blockquote>I used to delete stuff when I backed up to my computer…now with the iCloud, not so much. – Brenden
            </blockquote>
            <h4>Photo Organization Pain Points</h4>
            <p>Deleting photos is stressful because they are afraid they’ll forget or regret it. </p>
            <p>Comparing similar photos is tedious and going through photos is time consuming. </p>
            <blockquote>It's hard to compare them on the phone when you're swiping 
                – Ian

            <h3>Defining the Experience</h3>
            <p>The interviews and research defined what I wanted the experience to be and guided me when brainstorming ideas. 
            </p>
            <p>Empower people to take control of cloud storage. </p>
            <p>Make important photos & memories accessible.</p>
            <p>Choosing photos to keep is easy and stressless. </p>

            <h2>Brainstorming the MVP</h2>
            <p>I narrowed the scope for the MVP (minimum viable prototype) based on difficulty and importance. 
            </p>
            <figcaption>Sort similar/related photos together guide cleaning.</figcaption>
            <figcaption>Suggesting goals and showing progress.</figcaption>
            <figcaption>Have others help you vote on the best shots. </figcaption>
            <p>One task left behind was “seeing progress”.  It felt simple and was left out over risker tasks to test. In retrospect, I should have left this task in for testing…</p>

            <h2>Prototyping</h2>
            <p>Usability testing prototypes with real people allowed me to validate and iterate over my designs. 
            </p>
            <h3>Comparing Photos</h3>
            <p>Early iterations were complicated and cluttered so I split the actions like swwapping out a photo</p>
            <h3>Voting on Photos</h3>
            <p>Surprisingly, voting resonated the most with participants.  Participants mentioned several situations like collaborating on albums with friends or getting approval from friends before posting to social media.</p>
            <h3>Feedback</h3>
            <blockquote>Giving a little bit of feedback as they whittle down their photos could go a long way. 
                – Jeremy</blockquote>

            <h2>What I would have done differently</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Made progress more visible. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Thought more about how to show the value.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>What I learned</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Use familiar design patterns when possible.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Help the user complete their goals and engage with how they feel while they use it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I am not my user.  To me, Curate’s value was obvious but new users need to see how it benefits them.
